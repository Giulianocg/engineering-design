# Sustainable Blinds
This is the code for the project of group 82 of 2022 Q1 4WBB0 Engineering Design. The project entails creating a smart technology that aids living a sustainable lifestlye. Our group has decided to make digitally controllable blinds which can switch between sides which absorb and reflect heat from sunlight so as to reduce energy use from heating and cooling of a house.
